        You might be wondering, what this site is for? Well It is a Portfolio
        Site of mine with a Blog integrated into it. This Site is supposed to
        showcase my projects and some of the Blogs that i wrote or might write
        in the future.
      </p>

      <h4 class="text-error">Now, Let me guide you through the whole Site!!</h4>

      <p class="font-serif text-2xl">The Stack of this site is a follow:</p>
      <ul class="font-serif text-2xl">
        <li class="text-warning">Nuxt JS RC 13</li>
        <li class="text-warning">Tailwind CSS wih Dasiy UI</li>
        <li class="text-warning">Oh Vue Icons</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="font-serif text-2xl">
        The fonts used for the site are Nanum Pen Script and Mansalva. <br />
        The language being used to write code for the Site is TypeScript. Though
        I'm not that good at TypeScript and just started learning it, So there
        might be a few hiccups here and there.
      </p>

      <p class="font-serif text-2xl">
        This Site uses two themes, namely Dracula (for dark mode) and Pastel
        (for light mode). These themes can be toggled at will. Oh and the
        functionality to toggle between themes are written by me since existing
        solutions didnt pleased me.
